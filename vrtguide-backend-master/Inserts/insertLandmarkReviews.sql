(2,3,4,'Visiting this place was quite a pleasing experience. It was quiet and peaceful inside the basilica. The interior was amazing to look at, seeing as it was all gold. It ended up being a nice walk through the entire building, looking at  all the paintings and architecture. The outside of the basilica is very photogenic(with the right lighting). Many people were taking pictures at the arches and with the walls as a background. If you''re a follower of historical monuments and like visiting such places, then make this place a must visit on your trip to Goa'),
(2,4,4,'A beautiful masterpiece of a church. Very charming and great place to spend praying if you are Christian.  Otherwise if interested a paid guide will tell you the history behind the church etc.. only request to all is to maintain sanctity and decorum while in the church. Outside shopping area is really expensive and requires bargaining skills to get the right price'),
(3,5,5,'Very well maintained church. Clean an nice lighting. All people who put efforts into making this church amazing, hats off to you all.

(4,7,5,'I would really really recommend visiting these if going to Goa. It''s a 2 hour drive till the fall starting. From there you will be taken to the fall site in a government operated jeep safari. After that it''s a 15 minute trek to the fall site where you must take a dip. We were lucky enough to witness a train passing by the fall site while in water!'),
(4,8,4,'Dudhsagar Falls are fantastic and the off road trip to get there is also great fun. However, on the day I went there were so many people there that it was very hard going to reach the falls by foot. Also, it is really lovely to get into the cool water beneath the falls but again, there were so many people there that getting into and out of the water was a big problem. Feeding the monkeys there is also great fun. Overall, I would definitely recommend visiting Dudhsagar Falls but only if you don''t have mobility issue'),

A number of fruits, vegetables and spices are grown with immense love and care. A guided and informative tour of the plantation is given to every guest. Exploring the attraction is one of the best ways to come close to nature and take away a tip or two for one''s own little garden.

Lying at a distance of 16 km from Ponda, the nearest major connecting point, it can be reached by a private transport.

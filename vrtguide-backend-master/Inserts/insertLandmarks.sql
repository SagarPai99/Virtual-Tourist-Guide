A freshwater spring within the fort provided water supply to the ships that used to stop by. That is how it got its name: aguada means water. This fort served several other purposes. It has a capacity of storing 2376000 gallons of water, one of the biggest freshwater storages of the time in the whole of asia. This fort is divided in two segments: the upper part acted as a fort and watering station, while the lower part acted as a safe berth for the portuguese ships. Whereas, the upper part has a moat, an underground water storage chamber, gun powder room, lighthouse and bastions, it also has a secret passage to use during the time of war and emergency. The fort built at the mouth of the river mandovi, it was strategically located and was the chief defense of the portuguese against the dutch and marathas, capacitating around 79 cannons!

The church is called "Bom Jesus" meaning "good Jesus" or "infant Jesus" to whom it is dedicated. The Basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier in Goa.', 'The Basilica houses the sacred relics of St. Francis Xavier, patron saint of Goa who died in 1552. The mortal remains of the saint were gifted to the church by Cosimo de Medici III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Today, the embalmed body lies in an airtight glass coffin positioned in a silver casket crafted by a 17th century Florentine sculptor, Giovanni Batista Foggini. In accordance with his wishes, his remains were transferred to Goa the following year after his death. It is said that, while transferring, the saint''s body was found to be as fresh as the day it was buried. This miraculous phenomenon continues to attract the devout from all lands, and an Exposition or public viewing of his body happens, once every decade, to allow pilgrims to view it. The saint is believed to have miraculous powers of healing, and pilgrims come from all over the world to offer prayers. The silver casket is lowered for public viewing only during the public exposition. Last exposition was in 2004. Saint Francis has been buried in the church. He died in Sancian island or Shangchuan island when he was going to China. His body was taken to Portuguese Malacca but after two years it was brought to Goa. It is said that the saint’s body was fresh when it was brought to Goa. People of all communities can come here to visit the church as it is believed that saint has miraculous power of healing. People are given a chance to see the body of the saint after every 10 years. Intricately carved basalt embellishments make it one of the richest facades in Goa. The layout follows simple Renaissance norms while the detailing and decoration is unabashed Baroque. The mausoleum of St. Xavier is a marvel of Italian art (the marble base) and Hindu craftsmanship (the silver casket). The elaborately gilded altars are beautiful examples of sculptures and carvings in wood, stone, gold and granite. Columns are covered with marble and inlaid with precious stones. The church also houses paintings depicting the life of St. Francis Xavier. Visitors are overcome by the deep spirituality and tranquility of the place. Every year thousands of people visit the cathedral especially in December. A trip to Goa is incomplete without a visit to the revered Basilica. Every year on 3rd December, feast of Saint Xavier is celebrated in which many pilgrims come to visit the church. A pilgrimage is made to the church nine days before the feast or on the day of the feast is a must.

('Mae De Deus Church', 15.5471, 73.7852, 'It is the finest example of Neo-Gothic architecture in Goa. It houses the miraculous statue of Mae de Deus (Mother of God) which was brought from the ruins of the convent of Mae de Deus at Old Goa. Stark, stern and yet with a glamorous charm all its own, the Mae de Deus or Mother of God Church is a breath-taking site. With its Gothic spires and pristine white walls, it reminds one of a fairytale castle. Situated amidst picturesque surroundings of the typical Goan countryside, this Church at Saligao, which is situated in the Bardez taluka, was built in 1873. It is amongst the finest in the Gothic style and is attractively illuminated at night.', 'The church dedicated to the Mother of God or Our Lady came to be built at Bardez in the 19th Century. Its foundation stone was laid on 7th February 1867 and the Saligao Church was inaugurated on November 26, 1873. The Church building is stunningly distinctive with its jutting spires, each crowned with a cross. It has buttresses supporting its exterior walls and belfry. The courtyard of the Church contains another statue of the Mae de Deus, this one made of black stone. Before the construction of this church, the Saligao Catholics were part of the parish church of the Holy Trinity at the neighbouring village of Nagoa. However, the Saligaokars had a vested interest in building a parish of their own. One of the parishiners, Francisco Salvador Gama Pinto went as far as to take the matter up with the Archbishop of Goa. The Archbishop, being in favour of their proposal, enlisted the aid of Major Martins, who was the Inspector of Public Works, to draw up the plans for this church. It is said that the church was built with stones excavated from three different sites, two of them religious institutions. The black stones came from the ruins of the Mae de Deus convent in Daujim, the second lot of materials came from the Chapel of Our Lady of Victory, which was also close to ruination, while the balance was made up with stones from a nearby quarry. The church building shows all the hallmarks of the Gothic architectural style, with its walls being supported by massive buttresses, surmounted by elegantly tapering spires. The main portal of the church is almost a full story high with a beautiful domed shape. Above this there is a niche in the façade in which resides a statue of Our Lady. This is surmounted by the belfry, which houses two bells. A dome like structure with a jutting spire completes this rather unusual façade. The interiors of the church are similarly imposing. In addition to the miraculous statue of the Mae de Deus which reposes near the altar, there is an altar stone which was also taken from the convent in Daujim. In addition to the main altar, this church has six sub-altars. Some sources claim that the neighbouring parishes objected to the Saligao church receiving the honour of having the miraculous Mae de Deus statue kept within it. There was even talk of protests and marches, to the dismay of Fr. Camilo Teodorio Rodrigues, the administrator of the church who did not want to give up the statue. The issue was finally settled by the Government Order passed on the 20th of June, 1865 which was approved by the King of Portugal. Made possible by the endeavours of the faithful parishioners of Saligao and a singularly beautiful monument for the ages, do stop by this church as you pass it on the Chogm road from Panaji, if only to take a few pictures of its fantastical architecture.', '09:00:00', '12:30:00', null, null, 0 , 'https://www.trawell.in/admin/images/upload/121905709MaeDeDeus_Church_Main.jpg','https://www.trawell.in/admin/images/upload/121905709MaeDeDeus_Church_Main.jpg'),

The location of the Dudhsagar Falls is in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park which is in the middle of the Western Ghats. Between Karnataka and Goa, these waterfalls form the border making the area rich in biodiversity. There is a massive force of water created by these falls during the monsoon season.', 'Once there was a princess, the daughter of the king of Ghats was bathing in the lake located near her father s castle. After bathing, the princess along with her maidens sat beside the lake and drank milk from a jug. This jug was said to have been made of gold and embedded with precious stones and diamonds. One day while she was bathing in the lake, a handsome prince was riding through the woods, and on hearing the laughter sound, he was curious to see from where the sweet laughter sound was coming. The prince then saw the scarcely clad princess and to protect her honor, the maidens in a frantic attempt poured the milk from the jug which formed a curtain of milk around her. This curtain of milk which protected the modesty of the princess is known as the Dudhsagar Waterfalls. Lately, there is a lot of hype regarding the Dudhsagar trek stating that it is closed for the general public. It is brought to the notice that the Dudhsagar railway trek has been closed officially for the general public but the trek to the bottom of the Dudhsagar is still open for one and all. Two routes would help you to reach there. The first option is when you start the trek from Kulem and follow the jeep trail until you reach the bottom of the waterfall. The second option is when you enter the base of the waterfall through the railway track. If you wish to, then you can trek up to the Sonaulim station and then join the way back to the Mud route.

This is the only surviving tower of the four that were once a part of the Church of St. Augustine. What was once perhaps the biggest Church in Goa is now a crumbling ruin, largely deserted, with its glory days behind it. However, this ruin still has some secrets left to divulge to those who are willing to dig deep enough to find them.', 'History, Construction and Architecture : This complex was built by the Augustinian order. It comprised the church of Our Lady of Grace, the Convent of Saint Augustine, The College of Populo, and The Seminary of St Guilherme. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Grace. Its construction was started in 1597 and was completed around 1602. Originally comprising of four towers and a massive vault, the dimensions of this superb edifice placed it on par with the great imperial cathedrals of the Renaissance era. Legend and Lore : An old tale recounts how the vault of the church was problematic to construct and in fact fell down twice whilst being erected. The third time that it was put up, the architect, to show his confidence in his design stationed his only son within the church and ordered that a cannon be fired at the structure. Fortunately, his confidence was not misplaced, and the structure held. Archaeological Heritage : Even though the original church lies in ruins, it becomes ever more apparent that it yet has unplumbed depths. Careful study beginning in 1990 has recently resulted in the discovery of the remains of the lost martyr, Queen Ketevan of Georgia. There is little that can be seen today of the gracious and imposing church and monastery which once stood at this site, however, it is still considered worth a visit.

The hundred years spent on this construction, have indeed been well worth it, as the proud cathedral still stands tall and almost unblemished today. Built on a raised laterite plinth and covered in lime plaster, this cathedral measures 250 feet (76 m) in length, 181 feet (55 m) in breadth whilst its frontispiece stands 115 feet (35 m) high Interior and Artwork: The interior is laid out in a traditional cruciform shape, even though the exterior appears rectangular. The interior architecture is Corinthian. The main altar is dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria. Besides the main altar there are eight chapels along the sides of the nave and six altars at the transept. Pope Pius the XII conferred upon this shrine the Golden Rose, which is a gold ornament, a token of reverence and affection. The ornament itself has since been placed on the tomb of St. Francis Xavier. Visitors to this shrine should make it a point to see the magnificent reredos above the main altar whose six gilded panels depict the life of Saint Catherine, the fifteen communion tables, dedicated to Our Lady of Three Needs, Our Lady of Hope and Our Lady of Anguish and the baptismal font, built in 1532 which was used by St. Francis Xavier to baptize converts. Also worth seeing, is the chapel of the Cross of Miracles, where a vision of the Christ has been said to have appeared in 1919. Legend and Lore : Contrary to the idea that this chapel was built using funds from the Royal Treasury, some sources instead claim that it was built using money from the sale of properties that were impounded by the government. The Cross of Miracles (Khuris Milagre) is also credited with phenomenal power and significance some legends state that it is constantly, if slowly, growing, whilst others claim to have seen water spring from the rock upon which the cross is built. This Cathedral in Goa is not only worth a visit in its own right, but it is also convenient to several other tourist spots. The convent which adjoined the cathedral has been converted into an Archaeological Museum which is open to the public and the world famous Bom Jesus Basilica, lies just on the other side of the square.

Also, wearing comfortable shoes is of prime importance. The best time to actually undertake a trek in this area would be during the winter months when the climate is conducive to a challenging activity – from around the end of October to February is when most people decide to visit the area to trek. Safety instructions are usually given by the guide before the start of the trek highlighting the areas that are quite steep, thereby preparing the group for the task at hand.

However, there is a more interesting name given to this fort i.e. ‘Dil Chahta Hai’ Fort. The name literally translates to ‘the heart yearns’ and the reason for this quirky name is that a Bollywood film with this title (Dil Chahta Hai) was shot back here in 2001. The best time to visit Chapora Fort is evening time because sunset sky looks spectacular from here. Moreover, when the sky paints everything around, especially the Chapora River and beaches of Chapora, in its sunset colour, ah! the sight is just out of this world. The Chapora fort has been held by many rulers over the last few centuries. It was established by Mohammed Adil Shah who ruled the Bijapur dynasty between 1627 and 1656.He erected the fort here to prevent attacks by the Hindu raiders. The town was called Shahpura or “Town of the Shahs” after Adil Shah at the time. Although it was built to serve as a place of strategic importance for defence purposes, the fort fell very quickly in the test of military prowess. It was strongly believed that since the walls of the fort follow natural terrain, it was not possible to breach them. It was thought that these walls were impossible to be conquered, or not possible to be climbed up. But the Maratha leader Sambhaji came and broke this belief majestically as his army men scaled the walls with unmatched might and unparalleled ease. Entry is free to the fort. It is easily approachable from Mapusa which is located at a short distance of 10 kms. You can either take a personal drive or you can take a bus (starting from Mapusa) which will take you to the fort while ferrying to the final destinations of Anjuna and Vagator.
